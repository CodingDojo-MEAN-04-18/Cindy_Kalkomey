<!-- DojoQuery: Our assignment is to create our own DojoQuery library that exposes $Dojo to the global namespace. Let’s go over the functionality that $Dojo should have:
    * The ability to click on an HTML element with a specific id.
    * The ability to hover on an HTML element with a specific id.
Make sure you wrap your code in an immediate function (The immediate function pattern is a syntax that enables you to execute a function as soon as it is defined.)
    $Dojo("someIdForSomeButton").click(function() { console.log("The button was clicked!") });
    $Dojo("someOtherIdForSomeOtherButton").hover(function() { console.log("The button was hovered on!") });
Here are some hints that should help you get started:
    1 $Dojo should be a function that returns an object (an HTML element object)
    2 The object returned by the $Dojo function should have 2 added methods “click” and “hover”
    3 The click method that you attach to the object returned by the $Dojo function should take in 1 parameter which is a callback that gets run on that event.
    4 The hover method that you attach to the object returned by the $Dojo function should take in 2 parameters (what happens when you hover in and what happens when you hover out)
Your code should be wrapped in an immediate function that returns the $Dojo function. Here are some relevant built-in JS methods that should help:
    document.getElementById // (makes a DOMobject accessible to JavaScript) takes in one parameter which is the id for a particular element
    DOMobject.addEventListener //takes in 2 parameters 1) the event 2) the callback function (Note that this method must be run on an html element)
    //Also note that you will need to pay attention to the following built in events from the DOM
        DOMobject.click
        DOMobject.mouseover
        DOMobject.mouseout -->
